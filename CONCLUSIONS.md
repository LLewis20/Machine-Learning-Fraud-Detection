# CONCLUSIONS

### [NOTEBOOK](fraudDetectionProject.ipynb)

* Working on this project, I would get large amount of experience on machine learning techiques spanned around 2-3 months, during which I delved deep into the intricacies of machine learning for fraud detection. This not only helped my understanding of handling imbalanced datasets but also led me to experiment with a variety of models and techniques, enhancing my overall approach. Reflecting on this period, several key learnings stand out:
    * One of the earliest lessons, both in class and in practice, was the distinction between correlation and causation. Initially, I included gender as a feature in my model due to its apparent high correlation. However, a deeper analysis revealed an interesting twist: removing gender as a feature actually improved my model's ability to predict fraudulent transactions. This was a clear reminder that correlation does not inherently imply causation for my machine learning projects.
    * Accuracy isn't everything - when looking how others have approached this dataset many would claim that they had 99% accuracy with their models, after further research into the dataset you realize that there is a massive imbalance with the fraud and not fraud classes. The fraud cases only account for 0.58% of the data, so even if you got all the fraud cases incorrect you could still have a 99% accuracy which is not a good thing.
    * While trying to find a more effective model, my initial attempt was with a decision tree. However, it quickly became evident that decision trees struggled with the data's imbalance and were prone to overfitting. This had me lean towards exploring the random forest model. The random forest model had a more robust performance, handling the data imbalance better and having less tendency to overfit compared to the decision tree. This change in my project a pivotal point in my work, leading to more accurate and reliable predictions.
    * Later I would try to use a neural network but with the limited use we did in class I didn't really have the knowledge of using them, I would run into problems with them overfitting and they have a long computational time on my small laptop, that was another issues that I would have during this project was that my school laptop would take a long time to train different models throughout this projects lifetime. I don't have many of the notebooks that I worked on saved since I was doing more expiermenting with them and didn't know that they were something that was wanted.
